Tobacco health issue - need to know 

Self reported - tobacco use

Epigenetic
- DNA made up of ATGC the order determine genetic code
- GC are located together methyl groups can attach = epigenetic modification
- upon genetics
- While genetic code is stable, methylation is dynamic state depending on factors, environment etc.
- The methylation states can change the expression of genes. With methylation = silent
- Meth not random, with strong correlation between meth on specific meth sites with specific factors
- This means as a bio marker meth status can be used as a marker for indicating and reporting on environmental exposures and report on health outcomes
- Status of meth site can determine health outcomes including cancer risk

Machine learning in epigenetics
- Applications - screening risk, prognosis, patient information
- Stats produces - classification/labels, regression/scores
- Algorithms
    - Decision trees
    - Regression 
    - Examples (info in abstract)
- Technique elastic net regression
    - What it is/equation
    - Why it makes sense for epigenetic
    - Current best performance across all epigenetic (biological age)

Smoking algorithms
- Link elastic net two techniques, state their the best?
- Current algorithms
    - Dataset/cohort/demographic
    - Algorithm
    - Result/stat it produces
    - Limitations
